		<h1>Application Domain</h1>
	
		<p>
			This project is the requirements and design of an accounting system 
			that's intended to be comparable to Sage 50 and/or 
			QuickBooks. This development is to provide an enterprise grade 
			accounting system while keeping simplicity.  The system should 
			provide the following:
		</p>
	
		<img src='BusinessFlow.png' />

		<p>
			This demotes that a customer can have a quote provided that is then 
			turned into and order.  When the order has been shipped it's turned 
			into a invoice. If items are bad and have to be returned, the credit
			is created and any payments sent and received.  The same applies to 
			vendors.  Finally, all transactions may be related to a "job".  A 
			job is any business activity that we need to track.
		</p>

		<p>
			This does not show the back end accounting of journal entries, 
			account reconciliation, setup, and reporting.
		</p>
	
		<h1>Requirements</h1>

		<p>
			This covers what is required for the first public release.  This is 
			broken into functional and non-functional requirements.  A 
			functional requirement is a business task to be completed, while 
			non-functional requirements are everything else that must be 
			considered.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>
			This section covers the business objective the application will be 
			used to complete a task.
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Accounting Core</b><br/>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Accounts</b><br>
						These are the "accounting" accounts of asset, liability, 
						equity, revenue and expense.  We must our types should 
						account for year end closing considerations (close to 
						retained earnings).  Accounts should allow recursive 
						definitions making a "tree" structure.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Journal Entry</b><br/>
						This is the basis for all documents in the program.  
						Non-posting transactions will enter "0.00" lines.  The
						jounal entry should allow for tagging of lines to 
						contacts, jobs, departments (?).
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Register</b><br/>
						I would use the term check register, but that's almost 
						dated.  But we should provide a "register" style entry 
						for quick coding of account transactions.
					</li>
					<li><b>Bank Deposits</b></li>
					<li>
						<b>Reconciliation</b><br/>
						We should be able to "import" bank statements and create 
						the missing transactions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Contacts</b><br/>
						Contact are usually separate lists requiring a 
						redefinition is a vendor is also a customer.  We should 
						let vendors and customers "inherit" from contacts.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Inventory</b>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Items</b><br/>
						Item list management where items denote the 
						the following purchases, sales, and inventory: 
						description, unit measure, price, account.
						<ol>
							<li>
								<b>Non-Stock</b><br/>
								This is non tracked item definitions that can be 
								used through the documents.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Inventory</b><br/>
								This is just a cycle count of bought and sold.  
								The quantities on documents denote a unit bought
								or sold.  This should include the ability to 
								tag with locations.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Serialization</b><br/>
								For each quantity bought or sold, we must 
								document the serial number.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><b>Unit Measures</b></li>
					<li>
						<b>Unit Conversions</b><br/>
						Math can be used to convert measure of like types. if we 
						have an equivalency:
						
<pre>16 oz = 1 lbs
1 in = 2.24 mm
1 barrel = 55 gal</pre>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Assemblies</b><br/>
						Assemblies are definitions of formulas or recipes to 
						build a product or service.  Once "built" a new item 
						will exist.  It needs to be defined that a bunch of 
						items go in, and one item comes out.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Builds</b><br/>
						Normal accounting systems account for build as 
						definitive "recipes" for making a product.  When a 
						build is completed, we should account for the "actual"
						quantities used.
					</li>
					<li><b>Valuations</b></li>
					<li><b>Item Status</b></li>
					<li><b>Item History</b></li>
